# Restore creation dates of photos

When you export pictures from iCloud, they will have different creation 
dates. 
Export the pictures with a sequentiel filename and place them in the 
same folder as the two scripts.

Run the python script afterwards. Videos will use the date of the picture 
before and will add 1 minute to the creation time of the picture before.
